<h2 class="p-3 pt-5">What is Deep-Water Coral?</h2>

<p class="pt-3 fw-bold">Interesting Fact: </p>

<p class="pb-3">Deep-sea corals, like their warm-water cousins, are actually colonies of small animals that build a common skeleton, which grows into many shapes and colors.</p>

<p class="p-3">The habitat of deep-water corals, also known as cold-water corals, extends to deeper, darker parts of the oceans than tropical corals, ranging from near the surface to the abyss, beyond 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) where water temperatures may be as cold as 4 °C (39 °F).</p>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Bubblegum_coral_on_davidson.jpg" alt="Deepwater Coral and Fish" width="500rem" class="p-3">

<p class="p-3">While there are nearly as many species of deep-water corals as shallow-water species, only a few deep-water species develop traditional reefs. Instead, they form aggregations called patches, banks, bioherms, massifs, thickets or groves. These aggregations are often referred to as "reefs," but differ structurally and functionally. Deep sea reefs are sometimes referred to as "mounds," which more accurately describes the large calcium carbonate skeleton that is left behind as a reef grows and corals below die off, rather than the living habitat and refuge that deep sea corals provide for fish and invertebrates. Mounds may or may not contain living deep sea reefs.</p>
